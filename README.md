### An example React project written in Typescript

I have tried to use the following libraries in a bid to solidify my understanding. They are not necessarily required or even recommended to be used for such a simple application.

1. Redux
2. Redux-saga
3. Emotion 
4. Typescript
5. Parcel 
6. Jest
7. Reach router
