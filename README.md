### An example React project made with Typescript

I have tried to use the following libraries in a bid to solidify my understanding. They are not necessarily required or even recommended to be used for such a simple application.

* React
* Redux
* Redux-saga
* Emotion 
* Typescript
* Parcel 
* Jest
* Reach router
* Koa
* Eslint/Tslint
